# GOOGLE API SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (OAuth 2.0 for Personal/Developer Use)
# ============================================================================

# 1. CREATE GOOGLE CLOUD PROJECT
#    - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
#    - Create a new project or select an existing one.

# 2. ENABLE REQUIRED APIs
#    - In your project, enable the following APIs:
#    - Gmail API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com
#    - Google Drive API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com

# 3. CONFIGURE OAUTH CONSENT SCREEN
#    - Go to: APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
#    - User Type: External
#    - App name: "Candidate Screening Engine" (or similar)
#    - User support email: Your email address
#    - Developer contact information: Your email address
#    - Scopes: No need to add scopes here.
#    - Test users: Add your own Gmail address as a test user. This is critical
#      for the app to work while it's in "Testing" mode.

# 4. CREATE OAUTH 2.0 CLIENT ID
#    - Go to: APIs & Services > Credentials
#    - Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID"
#    - Application type: "Desktop app"
#    - Name: "Screening Engine Client" (or similar)
#    - Click "Create".
#    - A dialog will appear. Click "DOWNLOAD JSON".
#    - Save the downloaded file as `credentials.json` in a secure location.
#    - Update the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` in your `.env` file to point to this file.

# 5. CREATE GOOGLE DRIVE FOLDER
#    - Create a folder in your Google Drive for storing resumes.
#    - Copy the folder ID from the URL and update `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` in your `.env` file.

# 6. FIRST RUN & AUTHORIZATION
#    - The first time you run the `reasoning_engine.py` script, a browser window
#      will open asking you to authorize the application.
#    - Log in with the same Google account you added as a "Test user".
#    - Grant the requested permissions (send emails, manage Drive files).
#    - After authorization, a `token.json` file will be created in your project
#      directory. This file stores your authorization and will be used for
#      subsequent runs. Do NOT share or commit this file.
#
# NOTE: You do NOT need a Service Account or Domain-Wide Delegation for this setup.
# 6. TEST YOUR SETUP
#    Run: python google_drive_service.py
#    Run: python gmail_service.py
#    Both should initialize without errors

# ============================================================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================================================

# - NEVER commit .env file to Git
# - Add .env to .gitignore
# - Keep service account credentials secure
# - Rotate credentials periodically
# - Use least privilege principle for API permissions
# - Monitor API usage in Google Cloud Console

# ============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================================================

# Error: "Credentials file not found"
#   → Check GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH is correct absolute path

# Error: "Domain-wide delegation required"
#   → Follow step 4 above to enable delegation in Google Workspace Admin

# Error: "Insufficient permissions"
#   → Verify service account has proper API scopes configured

# Error: "Folder not found"
#   → Share Google Drive folder with service account email
#   → Verify DRIVE_FOLDER_ID is correct
